36 Fired MPD Officers Reinstated; Receive    $14 Million in Back Pay,2022-10-06,https://dcauditor.org/report/mpd-personnel-settlement-report,https://dcauditor.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MPD.Personnel.Settlements.Report.10.6.22.pdf,matched_title,"36 MPD officers who were fired and successfully appealed their terminations were awarded a total of $20.6 million, with the District paying out $14.3 million in back pay after subtracting wages earned while terminated. The most common reason terminations were overturned was that arbitrators deemed the punishment excessive, compounded by MPD's failure to meet deadlines, follow procedures, and provide adequate evidence; on average these reinstatement cases lasted nearly eight years. As of September 2022, 15 of the 37 reinstated officers reviewed were still employed at MPD, including three who had been terminated for misconduct classified as a Threat to Safety."

No comprehensive preventative maintenance program had been implemented, and key performance indicators were not consistently monitored or reported."

Council failed to provide the Science Advisory Board with adequate resources or staff support to effectively oversee the Department of Forensic Sciences' (DFS) independence, and approved regulations that contradicted the authorizing statute. The Stakeholder Council did not function as intended, key DFS customers bypassed established processes and conducted unilateral investigations that undermined agency independence, and DFS itself failed to manage customer relationships or comply with regulations and industry standards — contributing to the loss of its accreditation in 2021."
Vision Zero Part I: DDOT Made Progress on Engineering & Equity but Gaps Remain,2023-03-16,https://dcauditor.org/report/vision-zero-part-i-ddot-made-progress-on-engineering-equity-but-gaps-remain,https://dcauditor.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Vision.Zero_.Part-I.3.16.23.pdf,matched_title,"DDOT conducted safety studies that identified the District's most dangerous roadways but failed to consolidate findings into a comprehensive database for targeting and tracking traffic safety investments, delaying action to mitigate traffic danger. While DDOT made progress toward incorporating equity into its FY 2023 capital project selection, it lacked effective systems to document equity data on completed projects and had not implemented the equity goal for smaller Traffic Safety Investigation projects. Traffic fatalities in DC rose steadily since the Vision Zero Initiative launched in 2015, with disproportionate impacts in majority-Black Wards 7 and 8, which accounted for half of all fatalities from 2019 through 2021."
Multiple Failures in Roosevelt High School HVAC System,2023-03-30,https://dcauditor.org/report/7674,https://dcauditor.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/School.Modernization.Roosevelt.High_.3.30.23-2.pdf,matched_title,"Following a $136 million modernization of Roosevelt Senior High School completed in 2016, the newly installed variable refrigerant flow (VRF) HVAC system experienced persistent failures every year, resulting in frequent outages, loss of heating and cooling throughout the facility, and over $2 million spent on repairs and maintenance. Despite DGS engaging multiple third-party vendors and conducting numerous assessments, no single root cause was identified — rather, a combination of contributing factors, including the use of mechanical fittings contrary to manufacturer specifications, drove the ongoing failures, with months or years elapsing between the identification of issues and remediation efforts."

Fatal opioid-related overdoses peaked at 45% above expected levels during the pandemic, while fragmented and siloed data systems across the District made it difficult to fully measure the scope of increased need for behavioral health services."

Resident and healthcare personnel vaccination rates in D.C. were above the national average, though similar to surrounding jurisdictions."

However, data-driven reforms meant to boost transparency and inform evidence-based policing policy fell short: stop and frisk data went unused to address racial disparities, felony crime reports lagged years behind schedule, and a community policing working group and homicide task force both faltered due to low official engagement. Meanwhile, the Department of Forensic Sciences relied on retired MPD officers to staff its crime scene division rather than achieving its goal of full civilian staffing."

The plan was developed through a broadly inclusive process involving internal and external technology experts, parent and teacher stakeholder engagement, and a Technology Advisory Committee that reviewed and influenced multiple draft versions."

Code requirements during fiscal years 2020–2022 but forfeited $37,580 — nearly half its total allotments — due to missing documentation, unapproved quarterly reports, failure to participate in the ANC Security Fund in 2022, and late or absent report submissions. The compliance failures were attributable to the prior set of commissioners rather than those currently serving, and weaknesses were concentrated in documentation practices and internal financial controls."

Housing Authority (DCHA) as a mere ""related organization"" rather than a ""component unit"" as required under GASB accounting standards, omitting DCHA's financial data from the government-wide statements. The District provided DCHA with over $169 million in operating subsidies and $151.8 million in capital allotments between FY 2021 and FY 2023, establishing a clear financial benefit/burden relationship that — under GASB standards and the agency's own cited examples — requires DCHA to be reported as a component unit, and the mischaracterization exposed the District to potential legal risk under federal securities law because the 2022 ACFR was incorporated by reference into bond offering documents."

The District lacks a unified definition of crossover youth, has no consistent data-sharing or case coordination protocols between agencies, and only 8% of CFSA and DYRS case management staff reported receiving any training related to crossover youth, leaving a vulnerable population — disproportionately Black youth with histories of neglect — without coordinated or specialized support."

Racial equity gaps persisted throughout the program, with Black residents comprising 44% of the population but 68–89% of traffic fatality victims between 2016 and 2020, and DDOT, MPD, and DPW had not fully implemented equity-focused procedures or data collection into their enforcement strategies."

DHCD took no enforcement action against property owners who violated covenant requirements during the audit period, and its practice of allowing properties to run their own waitlists and lotteries created risk that units were leased to ineligible households."
