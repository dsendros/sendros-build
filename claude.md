## Features

### Dark/Light Mode Toggle
- Toggle button in the navigation bar
- Theme preference persisted to `localStorage`
- Smooth transitions between themes

### Hexagon Profile Photo
- Profile image clipped to hexagon shape using CSS `clip-path`
- SVG hexagon frame overlays the image
- On hover, the frame animates with a stroke drawing effect

### Sections
- **Hero**: Full-height landing with profile photo and introduction
- **About**: Brief bio section
- **Projects**: Responsive grid of project cards with hover effects
- **Contact**: Centered contact information with email link

### Responsive Design
- Mobile breakpoint at 768px
- Fluid typography and spacing adjustments
- Flexible project grid using `auto-fit` and `minmax()`

## CSS Variables (Theming)

### Light Mode (default)
```css
--primary-color: #2d3436;
--accent-color: #6c5ce7;
--text-color: #636e72;
--background-color: #ffffff;
--card-background: #f8f9fa;
```

### Dark Mode
```css
--primary-color: #ffffff;
--text-color: #b2bec3;
--background-color: #1a1a2e;
--card-background: #16213e;
```

## Hexagon Animation Details

The hexagon frame consists of two SVG `<path>` elements that each draw half of the hexagon:

1. **Right half**: Starts at top center (12 o'clock), traces clockwise to bottom center (6 o'clock)
2. **Left half**: Starts at bottom center (6 o'clock), traces clockwise back to top center

Animation is achieved via `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset`:
- Initial state: `stroke-dashoffset: 330` (path hidden)
- On hover: `stroke-dashoffset: 0` (path fully visible)
- Transition duration: 0.6s with ease timing

This creates the effect of the hexagon "drawing itself" starting from both the top and bottom points simultaneously.

## Next Steps

### Intro Sections
- Dennis to fill these out manually

#### Project 4 - Columbia Heights Station Alerts
- Raspberry Pi setup with train times and maybe other station alerts for Columbia Heights

#### Project 5 - DC Zoning Dashboard

A dashboard for tracking DC zoning cases, designed to help DC YIMBYs identify cases they may want to act on.

**Data Sources:**
- DCOZ Zone_Mapservice ArcGIS REST API Layer 46 (Zoning Cases Filed 2020-Present) - ZC and BZA cases
- DCOZ Zone_Mapservice ArcGIS REST API Layer 44 (Design Review) - treated as ZC cases
- DCOZ Calendar
- API base: `https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCOZ/Zone_Mapservice/MapServer`
- Results are paginated (1000 records per page) and deduplicated by Case_ID

**Completed Features (Phase 2):**
- [x] **Table and Card views** — Toggle between table (sortable, zebra-striped) and card grid views
- [x] **Case type filtering** — Filter by ZC or BZA
- [x] **Date range filtering** — Default to last 180 days, adjustable
- [x] **Unified search** — Search case numbers, addresses, descriptions, ANC
- [x] **Case detail modal** — Click row/card to see full case details
- [x] **IZIS links** — Click case number to open official IZIS page (URL built from case number)
- [x] **Address links** — Addresses in detail modal link to Google Maps
- [x] **SSL links** — SSL in detail modal links to DC zoning map
- [x] **Dark/light mode** — Consistent with other projects
- [x] **Responsive design** — Works on mobile and desktop

**Implementation:**
- `projects/zoning-dashboard/index.html` — Dashboard page
- `projects/zoning-dashboard/styles.css` — Styling with dark/light mode
- `projects/zoning-dashboard/app.js` — API queries, state management, rendering
- `projects/zoning-dashboard/data-fields.csv` — Field documentation

**Completed Features (Phase 3):**
- [x] **Calendar integration** — Fetches hearing dates from DCOZ Calendar via Cloudflare Pages Function (falls back to `corsproxy.io` locally), shows next upcoming hearing per case
- [x] **Upcoming hearings view** — Only future hearings displayed, uniform blue badges
- [x] **Default date range** - Remove default values from this field so that all cases are searched by default. Clarify what the field is searching on.
- [x] **Meeting type** - Add meeting type (public hear, public meeting, etc) to data. List in chart.

**Remaining Features:**
- [ ] **Cases without action** — Highlight cases pending action

**Notes:**
- Layer 44 (Design Review) cases are classified as ZC
- Previously used Layer 34/45 on Planning_Landuse_and_Zoning_WebMercator/MapServer — that data was stale (last updated 2019), migrated to DCOZ/Zone_Mapservice in Feb 2026
- Calendar proxy: uses Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/api/calendar.js`) in production; falls back to `corsproxy.io` for local development

#### Project 6 - ALJ Decision Database

DAB ALJs handle appeals from across HHS, including second-level appeals of CMS provider enrollment actions. The purpose of this database is to make searching, categorizing, and classifying ALJ decisions involving CMS easier than the current website.

**Resources**
- ALJ Decisions by year: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/dab/decisions/alj-decisions/alj-decisions-by-year/index.html

**Phase 1 - Extraction** - Extract all decisions from 2023-2025 involving CMS into a folder.

**Phase 2 - Categorization** - Build a searchable, filterable database that lists each decision. Fields should include name, petitioner, defendant, NPI, PTAN, Docket Number, Ruling/Decision Number, Decision Date, Result (Affirm, Overturn, Partially Affirm, Dismiss, etc)

**Phase 3 - Analysis** - Review each case to determine the issues involved (revocation, CMPs, deactivation, etc) and the regulations at play, if any. Add these to the filterable/searchable items.

**Phase 4 - Summary** - Write a summary of each case.

**Build note**
- Build this in such a way that it will not be visible on the website. I just want to use it locally in my browser.

**Implementation (Phases 1 & 2 complete):**
- `projects/alj-database/index.html` — Local-only dashboard (not linked from main index.html)
- `projects/alj-database/styles.css` — Result badge colors, extends ../../styles.css
- `projects/alj-database/app.js` — AppState, filters (text/year/result), sort, table/card views, detail modal
- `projects/alj-database/data.js` — Generated by scraper; `const DECISIONS_DATA = [...]`
- `scripts/alj_scraper.py` — Python scraper; run with `scripts/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/alj_scraper.py`
- `scripts/cache/decisions_cache.json` — Scraper cache keyed by URL; survives re-runs
- `scripts/.venv/` — Python venv with requests + beautifulsoup4

**Scraper notes:**
- HHS year index pages require a session warmup (visit homepage first) to avoid 403
- Discovery: 612 decisions across 2023–2025 (228 / 261 / 123)
- CMS detection uses a scoring system (threshold ≥10); non-CMS decisions excluded from data.js
- Result extraction uses conclusion/background region heuristics; "Unknown" rate may be high — TODO: replace/supplement with LLM analysis of cached decision text (`text` field in cache) for more accurate result classification
- Cache now stores full decision text (`text` field, stripped from data.js output) — available for LLM analysis without re-scraping
- CLI flags: `--limit N` (test), `--no-cache` (re-scrape all), `--from-cache-only` (regenerate data.js only)

#### Project 7 - ODCA Audit Recommendations Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for browsing, searching, and saving DC Auditor recommendations from the 2026 tracking spreadsheet (236 recommendations across 28 reports and 30 agencies).

**Data source:** `projects/odca-dashboard/150_Rec-Tracking-2026-Analysis-2.4.26-Appendix-download.xlsx`
**ODCA website:** `dcauditor.org` (not odca.dc.gov)

**Implementation:**
- `projects/odca-dashboard/index.html` — Dashboard page (linked from main portfolio)
- `projects/odca-dashboard/styles.css` — Status badge CSS, multi-select dropdowns, report accordion, scorecard bars, note dot indicator, personal note textarea, save list controls, @media print; extends ../../styles.css
- `projects/odca-dashboard/app.js` — AppState (filters use Sets for multi-select), sort, table/card/report/scorecard views, save feature (named lists), detail modal (copy + personal notes), export CSV, print
- `projects/odca-dashboard/data.js` — Generated by converter; `const ODCA_DATA = [...]`
- `scripts/odca_converter.py` — Reads XLSX, scrapes report URLs from dcauditor.org, writes data.js
- `scripts/cache/odca_urls_cache.json` — URL scraping cache keyed by report title
- `scripts/.venv/` — Requires openpyxl in addition to requests + beautifulsoup4

**Views:**
- **Table** — Sortable table; report name is a link when `report_url` exists; row click opens detail modal
- **Cards** — Card grid; same link behavior
- **Reports** — Accordion grouped by report (sorted by date desc); header shows X/Y implemented + progress bar + agency list; body lists recs with agency/status/text
- **Scorecard** — Per-agency table with implemented/in-progress/not-started/no-action/no-info counts and % done bar; sortable columns; clicking an agency row expands nested report accordion (same structure as Reports view); expanded state persisted in `AppState.expandedScorecardAgencies` / `AppState.expandedScorecardReports`

**Progress bar behavior:** Stats (X/Y implemented, % done) in Report and Scorecard views always reflect **all recs** (`AppState.recommendations`), not just the filtered subset. Count columns in Scorecard (Total, Implemented, etc.) still reflect filtered recs. This prevents bars from inflating to 100% when filtering by a single status.

**Filters:**
- Text search, multi-select agency, multi-select status, multi-select report, date from/to, saved-only
- Active filter chips show count ("Agency: 3 selected") and can be individually cleared; chips are centered below results count
- Report multi-select is sorted A–Z (`localeCompare`); agency multi-select is also A–Z
- `AppState.filters.agencies/statuses/reports` are `Set`s; `dateFrom`/`dateTo` are YYYY-MM-DD strings

**Converter notes:**
- Run with `scripts/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/odca_converter.py`
- CLI flags: `--no-scrape` (skip URL scraping), `--from-cache-only` (regenerate data.js only)
- URL scraping: fetches all reports via `dcauditor.org/wp-json/wp/v2/report` (WP REST API, ~632 reports), matches XLSX titles by normalized first 50 alphanumeric chars
- Report name field format: `"Title (MM/DD/YYYY)"` — parsed with regex into title + ISO date
- Some rec numbers are non-sequential (recs directed at all agencies listed once); 23 report+rec combos appear for multiple agencies
- Duplicate report+rec IDs get `-2`, `-3` suffix; null rec text filled from first row with same report+rec
- Status values from spreadsheet: `"Implemented"`, `"In progress"`, `"Not yet started"`, `"No action intended – management accepts the risk"`, `"No information available"`

**Save lists:**
- `AppState.saveLists: { 'Default': Set, ... }` + `AppState.currentListName`; `AppState.saved` is a live reference to the active list's Set
- `loadSaveLists()` migrates legacy `odca_dashboard_saved` key into Default list on first load
- UI: `<select id="save-list-select">` + `[+]` (new) + `[🗑]` (delete, hidden for Default)
- `persistSaved()` delegates to `persistSaveLists()` so all existing call sites still work

**Notes feature:**
- `AppState.notes: {}` keyed by rec `id`; stored in `odca_dashboard_notes`
- Textarea in detail modal with 500 ms debounced auto-save; `.value` set directly (not innerHTML)
- `.note-dot` indicator in save column (table) and card meta footer; updated live via `updateNoteDot(id)`

**TODOs:**
- [ ] **Report Summaries** — Add summaries of every report to the Reports tab. When a user clicks a report, the summary should display above the recs.
- [x] **Link to report** — Report name is a link in table, card, report accordion, and detail modal title
- [x] **Report View** — Accordion grouped by report; header shows X/Y implemented + progress bar; body lists every rec
- [x] **Advanced filtering** — Multi-select dropdowns for agency, status, and report; selection stored as Sets
- [x] **Date filter** — Date from/to inputs filter by `report_date` (YYYY-MM-DD string comparison)
- [x] **Agency accountability scorecard** — Sortable table ranking agencies by % implemented with inline bar chart
- [x] **Scorecard view accordion** — Clicking an agency expands a nested report accordion; clicking a report expands recs; expanded state persisted in AppState
- [x] **Add Agency to Report View** — Unique agencies listed in report accordion header (dot-separated)
- [x] **Replace agency acronym with full agency name** — `agencyDisplayName()` maps acronyms to full names in all views
- [x] **Recommendation count in dropdowns** — Show totals next to each agency/report option (e.g., "MPD (47)")
- [x] **URL hash state** — Encode active filters in URL hash for bookmarking/sharing filtered views
- [x] **Export as CSV** — `exportCsv()` exports `AppState.filtered`; columns include Personal Note; proper CSV quoting
- [x] **Copy to clipboard** — "Copy" button in detail modal copies recommendation text; flips to "Copied!" for 2s
- [x] **Print view** — "Print" button calls `window.print()`; `@media print` hides nav/filters/controls/modal
- [x] **Personal notes** — Per-rec textarea in detail modal, 500ms debounce, stored in localStorage; note dot indicator in table + cards
- [x] **Named save lists** — `AppState.saveLists` dict of named Sets; select + [+] / [🗑] UI; migrates legacy saved key
- [x] **Charts tab** — Status distribution donut/bar chart
